# FastSS
A derivation of Fast Similarity Search with some differences to keep search time consistent with the average case.

## Issues
* Does not build in an appropriate timeline
* Should not include the index of a word multiple times for a single match

## TODOs
* Benchmark
* More unit tests (especially for different sizes of d)
